# kanji-search
React Website to help learn Kanji

# Currently Available
A few hundred Kanji, each with their own webpage link, word definitions, can search for Kanji using english definiton, onyomi reading and kunyomi reading, ability to hide and show definitions so as to quickly practice them, further links to other websites for more info

# Next Steps
My current Kanji Knowledge is *Approx. 500* so I am using this app to learn more kanji as I keep adding them, once I have reached 2000, i will switch over to an API for the Kanji and their definitions.

# Future Features 
Essentially there will be 2 main features of this website, one of them is essentially what I currently have, basically a dictionary like so many other Kanji websites. 
The second feature will be your own libary and profile in which you can store new Kanji in any order and as many as you want, add notes, rate how well you think you them in terms of reading / definition. Then after adding a quiz feature which I imagine you will tick certain amount of kanji from your homepage or just click on a specific kanji and a modal will pop up and you can select to test reading/meaning or all. And it will be a quick quiz based on the kanji you select. 
I can expand a lot on these two features too but that is the general guideline for now.
